# Squirrel!

## Welcome to the Squirrel App

The squirrel represents the constant distractive nature of a human with ADHD. Our attention bounces from one thing to the next, easily distracted, forever on the hunt for that next dose of dopamine.

Often, this search for stimulation manifests in the form of hobbies, and that's where **The Squirrel App** comes in.
